            <li>3 cups torn bread cubes (About half a loaf)</li>
            <li>2-3 tbsp olive olive</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        <h3>Dressing</h3>
            <li>1/4 cup mayonaisse</li>
            <li>1 clove minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 tbsp fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 tsp anchovy paste</li>
            <li>1 tsp worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 tsp dijon mustard</li>
     </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <h3>Croutons</h3>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375°F.</li>
            <li>Drizzle bread cubes with enough olive oil so they are all very
                lightly coated. Toss and add salt.</li>
            <li>Spread out onto a sheet pan and bake until edges turn brown,
                7-10 minutes. Keep a close eye on them so they don’t burn, stir
                and toss them as needed.</li>
            <li>Set aside while you prepare the rest of the salad. Can be made
                several days in advance and stored in an airtight container</li>
        <h3>Dressing</h3>
            <li>Whisk together all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Store in the fridge until ready to use. Can be made at least 1
                week in advance.</li>
        <h3>Salad</h3>
            <li>In a large bowl, toss lettuce with enough dressing to lightly
                coat the leaves (or to your preference).</li>
            <li>Add croutons and parmesan cheese and toss again.</li>
